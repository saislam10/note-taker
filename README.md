## Description
In this challenge, there is code which builds out a note taker. When I first open up the page, I am presented with a page which says "note taker" and has a "get started" button. Once that button is clicked the user is sent to another page which is the actual notes page. On the right-hand side, the user can enter notes, click the save button, and the title is saved to the left-hand side. If the user clicks the saved title on the left-hand side, the notes show up on the right-hand side. If the user clicks the delete button, that specific note is deleted. This application is deployed to heroku, and is overall a way to take, save, and delete notes.
